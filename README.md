# Motivation

Why we do what we do...


# Scope

This project will implement all necessary components of the V2G PKI
infrastructure. However, since some of these components require an
active link to a charging station or an electric vehicle, some parts
will be implemented as mockup services to simulate these hardware
components. The focus lies on the PKIs rather than on the
_ISO/IEC 15118_ interface between car and infrastructure.
